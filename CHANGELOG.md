## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Plugin manifest** (`plugin.json`) — enables future marketplace distribution
- **Unified `/git` skill** with 3 sub-commands: `commit` (governed commit), `pr` (governed pull request), `lookback` (retrospective) — all share a common rebase + 2-pass diff review baseline. Includes `checklists/` for critical, informational, and suppression patterns
- **7 path-scoped rule files** (`.claude/rules/`): governance, logging, debugging, testing, codebase-scanning, parallel-execution, skills-and-subagents — 859 lines covering all 9 policies (§1–§9)
- **3 governance hooks** (`hooks/`): check-ticket-exists (PreToolUse), log-file-change (PostToolUse), verify-tests-exist
- **Playwright MCP** (`.mcp.json`) — browser automation for UX Smoke Test Gates
- §9 added to CLAUDE.md Policy Reference Index

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md` — added new skills, Rules section (7 files), expanded Hooks, Playwright MCP section
- `README.md` — complete rewrite with comparison table, progressive disclosure, full references
- `.claude/TeamDocument/10. GitHubReference/` — upstream PR process documentation
- Version bumped to 2.0.0

## [1.3.1] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **No-Code-Before-Ticket Rule** in §4 (`policies/04_Development_Structure.md` + `CLAUDE.md`)
  - No code change permitted until a Development folder ticket exists
  - Covers all scenarios: live-discovered bugs, approved features, quick fixes, urgent issues
  - Conductor enforcement duty with violation logging requirement
  - Commander override clause: only Commander can waive this rule for a specific change
  - Origin: real-world deployment where live session momentum caused repeated §4 violations

---

- Development structure policy (04) — fixed backslash paths to forward slashes

### Removed
- `TeamDocument/2. Team Roster/` folder — agents/ is sole identity source (no duplicates)

- `/template-status`, `/template-changelog`, `/template-check`, `/template-diff`, `/template-apply`, `/template-rollback` split skills — consolidated into single `/template` command
- Medica — domain-specific to AeroMedica project; not part of base framework
